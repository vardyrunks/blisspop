Getting Started 
---------------

To get started with Android/BlissPop, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the BlissPop trees, use this command:


    repo init -u https://github.com/TeamBliss-LP/android.git -b lp5.0

Then to sync up:

    repo sync (-j4) (-j8) (-j16)- This depends on number of cpu cores- use just "repo sync" if you are unsure.

To build for your device, and use PREBUILT_CHROMIUM Command.

. build/envsetup.sh

breakfast *device name here*

export USE_PREBUILT_CHROMIUM=1

brunch *device name here*

or make is all one line.

. build/envsetup.sh && breakfast *device name here* && export USE_PREBUILT_CHROMIUM=1 && brunch *device name here*
